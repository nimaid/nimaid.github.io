but Hobbytown has now moved to the new location at 807 Oregon St.&nbsp; There

<p align="left">Daryl doing some end of day clean up.&nbsp; The Dorsey's, Rob
Henderson, Troy and Jeff helped today in addition to more people last
week.&nbsp;&nbsp; I like the looks of the floor to the right of the
picture.&nbsp; We are getting down to almost what the Eagles Club is, we will be
sanding it also.</p>

<p align="left">Another view of the cleaned area.&nbsp; More than 2/3's left,
hurry to sign up to help.</p>
<p align="left">Also coming this next week, new bathroom's start being
constructed.</p>
<p align="left"><font color="#FF0000" size="6">Previous posts-</font></p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial Black">Well, here are a few pictures to help show our
direction.&nbsp; Oshkosh R/C has procured a building that will be specifically
used for racing in 2003.&nbsp; At present, we will continue to run at Studio
Hall (the former Eagles Club) but will hopefully run the last season in the new
digs.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial Black">This represents a major investment in the R/C
program in the Oshkosh area.&nbsp; There is no way this alone can produce a
payback.&nbsp; Possibly long term, it may pay its own heat bill.&nbsp; Why do
this?&nbsp; To support you our racers and to make our program growth
continue.&nbsp; We will be trying to run on more days (spread out the programs
so they don't go so late at night).&nbsp; We wish to allow more people to enjoy
the sport and we also wish to open some nights just for practice times.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial Black">With 5 other indoor tracks within 100 miles,
why have
we done this?&nbsp; Again, our numbers are staggering in the R/C world.&nbsp;
What we call a low attendance day is a big event for others.&nbsp; This comes
around because we (the people who run the program) have fun doing this.&nbsp; It
is not for money, its for fun, smiles, achievement and getting together with
friends.&nbsp; We hope you join us in making this a positive place for not only
the Fox Valley, but for the state.&nbsp; You see, we will be going after major
races also to supplement our local groups and that will help cover the
investment.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial Black">Now, we need help.&nbsp; The pictures below are
after one weekend of work by Bob Giese and crew.&nbsp; This was a former
furniture store with plenty of partitions and fake inner walls.&nbsp; It also
needs serious upgrades of insulation, lighting and facilities.&nbsp; We have a
very tight budget, volunteers are needed for another couple of weekends (or
nights) to whip this into shape.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial Black">After clean up, we wish to stud the walls and
insulate (along with freshening the electrical drops), replace the drop ceiling
with new energy efficient lighting and do something with the windows.&nbsp; If
you know a supplier who would be interested in donating (for reduced costs or
advertising exchange) let me know.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3">Now, on to the quick tour-</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3">The actual address is 807 Oregon Street.</font></p>
<p align="left"><img border="0" src="Dsc00343.jpg" width="408" height="308"></p>
<p align="left">The view from across the street.&nbsp; Our building is the one
with the blue awning on the front (yes, all 65+ feet wide.&nbsp; It is two full
floors high with the front room 80 feet long.&nbsp; There is parking on Oregon,
8th street, 9th street and in various lots that are closer than we have to deal
with now.</p>
<p align="left"><img border="0" src="Dsc00345.jpg" width="406" height="307"></p>
<p align="left">The main lobby area where the existing track carpet will go to
finish the season.&nbsp; Yes, there remains plenty of pit space and room for
soda/snack machines and there is a pizza place next door.&nbsp; The run line of
the track will not change, except there will be two pipes in the infield.</p>
<p align="left"><img border="0" src="Dsc00344.jpg" width="415" height="314"></p>
<p align="left">This is the 9th street entrance (under the red awning).&nbsp;
The dumpsters are not ours and will be moved.&nbsp; This is just around the
corner of 9th and Oregon.&nbsp; This lot will hold 10-15 cars.</p>
<p align="left"><img border="0" src="Dsc00346.jpg" width="417" height="314"></p>
<p align="left">The back room, upstairs (65' x 60', that is about the size of
the Eagles Club floor).&nbsp; This is projected for road racing and slot car
tracks by the fall of 2003.&nbsp; Sorry the picture turned out dark, it was late
in the afternoon.&nbsp; We need someone with a concrete surface cutter to level some
areas, anyone have one??</p>
<p align="left"><img border="0" src="Dsc00348.jpg" width="371" height="281"><img border="0" src="Dsc00349.jpg" width="370" height="281"></p>
<p align="left">The front room of the upstairs.&nbsp; Sixty five foot wide by
eighty foot long.&nbsp; It needs the carpets to be torn up, under layment put down and
the ceiling replaced.&nbsp; It may look a little rough now (after two days of
tear out by Bob Geise and his crew, this looks good to me) but it will come around.&nbsp; The windows are
a welcome treat but need storms (anyone??).</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">So, we really need contractors in both electrical and plumbing
(lets just say we need to freshen the facilities).&nbsp; We need discounts on
(or donations of) labor, wood, insulation, ceiling materials light fixtures,
sound systems, video systems, tile and carpet (not for the track, but for the
other areas).&nbsp; Basically, let me know what may be out there to help us
bring you the ultimate race facility.</p>
